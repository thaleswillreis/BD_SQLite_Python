# Educational project for creating a database using Python and SQLite

This project is a simple demonstration of the basic creation of a SQLite database using Python.

The project contains two files written in Python that perform the same function (creating a database). One of the files is in notebook format (.ipynb) and the other is in standard Python script format (.py) and both can be used to generate a database as long as the path of the script file is followed or readjusted.

In the Data folder there are two files, the script used to create the database tables and the database itself created for demonstration purposes.

**Note:** The Python codes were written in such a way that each time they were executed, the database would be deleted and a new one would be created. Therefore, this code was not intended to be used in production and is only an educational project.

## Technologies Used

This project was executed using Python and SQL. Git (code versioning), DBeaver for testing, SQLite as database technology and the code editor VSCode were used under Debian Linux as the Operating System.
